# Proprietary Codec Support

Support for proprietary video codecs (e.g. H264) relies on flags being set during the compilation process. As a result it is not possible to use the binary distribution of CEF and you need to build from source yourself.

These instructions are currently Windows-only. OS X version of Cinder-CEF is a work-in-progress and you can reac more about that [here](osx_notes.md)
